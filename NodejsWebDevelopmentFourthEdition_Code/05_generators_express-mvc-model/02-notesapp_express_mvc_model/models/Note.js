/*
 * With the Note class, we have used Symbol instances to provide a small measure of data hiding.
 * JavaScript classes don't provide a data-hiding mechanismâ€”you can't label a field private as
 * you can in Java, for example.
 *
 * Each time you invoke the Symbol factory method, a new and unique instance is created. For example,
 * Symbol('foo') === Symbol('foo') is false
 *
 * >> The bottom line is that using Symbol objects for the fields provides a small measure of
 * implementation hiding.
